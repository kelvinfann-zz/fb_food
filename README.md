**NOTE: the actual fb_food is not actually used for anything except linking up the app. In reality this app could probably just stand alone.

This project was written for the test project assignment by ginger.io.

The heart of the code is mainly in the ‘events/fb_fetch.py’. It handles the HTTP calls to Facebook, the parsing of the retrieved json data, and some small bits of other utility.
